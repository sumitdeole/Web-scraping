## Web scraping project about *Walt Disney movies*
### **Description:** 
We will scrape movie information (producers, directors, cast, budget, etc.) of Walt Disney movies from Wikipedia pages. The project is divided into two exercises:
1. Get movie information on a famous Walt Disney Movie: Toy Story 3: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_Story_3
2. Get the list of all Walt Disney movies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures_films

### Python packages
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Prettify
- Pandas



##### *Disclaimer:* I already confirmed what is allowed concerning web scraping in wikipedia's rules present in their robots.txt. All is well here.
